# Dzip Shell Extensions

Simple shell extensions for Dzip v3.1

## Install/Uninstall

Run "dzip_shellext_install.bat" or "dzip_shellext_uninstall.bat" respectively as
admin (right-click on the files and click "Run as admin").

Note that dzip.exe is assumed to be right next to these .bat scripts, as should
be the case in your downloaded files. If dzip.exe is ever moved after
installation, the shell extensions will not work anymore. To fix this, just run
the .bat scripts properly again.

## Usage

Compression: Select any number of files and folders, right-click and choose
"Send To > Dzip". This will create an archive in your current directory
containing all selected files.

Decompression: Right-click any .dz file and choose "Extract with Dzip". This
will unpack all files into your current directory (as long as filepaths within
the .dz are relative).

Note that on Windows 11, these menus will only be available in the extended
context menu accessed by "Show more options".
