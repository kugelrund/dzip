Description             : Dzip is a program for file compression.
                          It's advantage over more popular compression
                          software is in the size of the program, only 120k,
                          easily fitting on a floppy disk.  Also it's
                          compression is on par with standard .zip file
                          compression and is sometimes marginally better.

                          Dzip's original purpose was to compress demo
                          recordings of the id software game Quake much better
                          than any other program, and it still does this.

Credits                 : Nolan had the original idea for Quake demo
                          compression, Stefan created the inital version with
                          just that purpose, and Nolan started the Windows GUI
                          and expanded the program to be general purpose.

                          Sphere started contributing in 2021 and added support
                          for PROTOCOL_FITZQUAKE (protocol 666).

Additional Credits to   : Jean-Loup Gailly and Mark Adler whose Zlib
                          compression library is used by Dzip (see inside
                          source package for more information).

===========================================================================

Version history:

24.04.25: Version 3.2
          Fixed -s option of command line version on Windows

13.06.23: Version 3.1
          Fixed double clicking files not opening associated programs
          Removed obsolete self-extraction feature and shell extensions
          New simple shell extensions, see dzip_shellext.txt

18.04.21: Version 3.0
          Added support for PROTOCOL_FITZQUAKE (protocol 666).
          Updated zlib to v1.2.11

07.05.03: Version 2.9
          Dzip is now independent of the .dz format, it can work with potentially
           any format by using plugin dll files.  Included in the original 2.9
           relase is dlls for .dz files and .pak files, a format used by some games.
          Dzip isn't so tight about sharing the file that it has open now, for
           example now you can use ICQ to send a file that Dzip has open.

31.07.02: Version 2.84
          Fixed hopefully all remaining drag and drop problems, in 2.83 I broke
           dropping on a file that accepts drops (like a .dz) for win2k/XP
          Fixed encountering a .dem inside a pak that failed the dem test, or a
           file that failed to compress would result in random behavior
          Fixed test/extract of a file that had a corrupt file would give a
           meaningless error like "error in inflate feed (-3)" that did not go
           away when you pressed OK;  Now you'll get a CRC error
          Fixed a few more minor progress bar issues, it works when more than
           4GB of files are compressed at once, for example
          Fixed not paying attention to the rule in win2k/XP about not
           displaying underlines in menus unless the alt key is used
          Fixed a new install would not get 'Compress with Dzip' when right
           clicking on a file until DzipGui.exe was started for the first time
          Fixed stupid mistake in 2.83 code changes resulted in menu icon for
           view to be the one for test, and test to not have one

28.06.02: Version 2.83
          Fixed drag out and drop on treeview of an explorer window on win2k
           and XP would freeze up both Dzip and the explorer window
          Fixed drag out and drop on a non-explorer app and then aborting the
           extract would still cause the other app to try to open the file
          Fixed some progress bar problems and added a smooth option
          Fixed compressing a directory would not compress any subdirectories
           that had names starting with a period
          Fixed compressing a directory that you do not have permission to
           browse caused a garbled error message, or worse
          Fixed couldn't select text in internal viewer with mouse in 2k/XP
          Fixed directories wasting 8 bytes of space in the .dz
          Fixed more minor memory and resource leaks
          Fixed auto-lowercase and sort to work with non-english characters
          Fixed caps lock state affecting Shift+key shortcuts
          Fixed crash on asking to overwrite a file with really long name
          Fixed another bad-dem compression problem
          Fixed aborting at just the right time while adding files would crash
          Don't ask to create a directory if you can't create it
          Don't differentiate between "path" and "path\" in move/extract paths
          Don't let windows handle critical errors, including unexpected crash
          Store files at 0% whenever compression was unsuccessful, no matter
           what the file size is (previously limited to 8MB)
          Files of size 2GB to 4GB-1 can now be compressed, 4GB+ gives error
          Added more system error prints to give more information
          Sped up drag out and drop to explorer for .dem in win 9x
          More things too minor to mention even here

31.05.02: Version 2.82
          Fixed crash on double clicking the main part of window when
           there was no open file
          Fixed dropping files on Dzip was disabled after closing a file
          Fixed problems when a file dropped on Dzip could not be compressed
          Fixed double clicking a column border to auto size the column
           would not adjust the horizontal scroll bar if it was necessary
          Fixed progress bar being off while testing a file that had
           any pak files which were expanded
          Fixed error boxes being on top of another application if Dzip was
           not the foreground app when the error occured
          Fixed extract sometimes failing without giving an error message
          Fixed not giving an error message when reading a file during
           compression encountered problems (eg bad sector)
          Fixed crash on attempt to compress files that were >= 2GB in size
          Fixed another problem with .dem compression
          Fixed some resource leaks
          Fixed running out of disk space while extracting a pak would
           give out of disk space error message twice
          Fixed always using "Folder" instead of the appropriate locale
           description in the type column
          Changed CRC error message to actually say what file is bad
          Prevent the window from being restored completely offscreen at
           startup (eg after reducing the desktop resolution)
          More informative errors about entering bad filenames or paths
           in various dialog boxes
          Updated zlib library to v1.1.4 (thought i did this in 2.8 but nope)

14.05.02: Version 2.81
          Fixed hopefully all problems with compressing/uncompressing of
           .dem files that, in some way, were not valid Quake demos
          Fixed commands left active when chosing a file from recent file list
           which could not be opened, and there was a previously open file
          Fixed minor problem with internal viewer when files were >= 64KB

03.05.02: Version 2.8
          Sped up Dzip tremendously when working with .dz files that
           contain thousands of files (mostly opening it)
          Expanding/Collapsing of a pak file is now (nearly) instantaneous
          Operations involving a lot of small files are faster because
           the status bar won't update each individual message anymore
          Added option to turn off "Compress with Dzip" in explorer menus
          Added "Extract all to here" when right clicking on more than
           one .dz file in explorer windows
          Allow \\netdrive\path for the default extract path in an sfx
          Added Yes/No to all buttons for overwrite prompt in an sfx
          Fixed chosing an existing, read only file for a file to add
           files to would cause "error: no error"
          Fixed entering a bad path in file->new (like z:\test) would
           not give an error message
          Fixed some problems that occured if you changed system fonts/
           number formats while Dzip was running
          Fixed adding a .pif/.lnk file would add what those files were
           shortcuts for instead of the .pif/.lnk file
          Fixed some menu/file-type bugs under Windows 2000/XP

01.07.01: Version 2.6
          Added 'extract to current directory only' option for self-
            extracting exe files
          Added info screen to self-extracting exe so that people
            using them know what program made them
          Fixed files with 0% compression not working in self-extracting
            exe files
          Made it so just pressing ok for the directory to extract in a
            self-extracting exe will extract files to the current directory
          Fixed crash on compressing a file dated after y2.038k

11.02.01: Version 2.55
          Self extracting exe's now perform CRC checks and can have
            a default extract directory
          Added "No to All" and "Extract as..." buttons in the
            "Overwrite file?" dialog box
          Fixed issues with overwriting files when dragging to applications
          You won't get a negative compression ratio anymore
          Smaller Fixes (F2-rename problems, small memory leaks, progress
            bar issues, more data validation)

26.01.01: Version 2.51
          Fixed problems with big toolbar's disabled buttons
          Fixed some issues with the uninstall
          Fixed installer giving files the wrong dates

22.01.01: Version 2.5
          Download is now an install program
          Smaller exe/dll sizes
          Extraction of Quake demo files now 4x or more faster
          Added optional large toolbar
          Self extracting exe files work above 256mb, have less overhead,
            and warn when there's extraction problems
          Fixed all issues related to path column, including sort
          Settings are stored on a per-user basis if you use a
            multi-user machine
          Sped up opening very large .dz files
          Fixed problems where commands were selectable when they shouldn't be
          Added sort by extension
          Changed the tooltips to be a bit more descriptive

01.01.01: Version 2.4

          Added "Sort by" in options menu
          Fixed file dats being off when they are dragged to explorer windows
          Fixed crash on deleting the last file of a .dz, if it was
            an expanded pak
          Changed about box to point to new webpage

20.11.00: Version 2.3
          Added expandable pak files, now you can see all the files inside
             a pak and extract them individually
          Fixed sort problems when path column was on
          Fixed problems with selection box not always being used correctly

            Added compressing of whole folders by right clicking on them in
               the shell, or by dragging them into the dzip window.  (you can't
               add folders directly from Actions->Add yet)
            Drag files out of dzip to various applications (but not the
              shell, sorry :P)
            Fixed inflate_feed bug after moving/renaming a dz file

          Display file date, compressed size and ratio for v2.0 files
          Can extract just certain files instead of all of them
          Dialog box to ask if you want to overwrite a file
          Can move and rename dz's from the file menu
          Lists of recently opened files, extract paths and move paths
          Shell extension:
            Can right click on non-dz files and pick "compress with dzip"
            Can right click on dz files, drag them wherever and pick
              "extract here"
            Can drag files onto a dz file to add them

Comparison of Dzip's compression on Quake demo files,
 (these results were from v1 of dzip)

Demos            Zip size   Dzip size   Ratio

SDA Nightmare
run records        3.51M      1.78M     50.6%

SDA Nightmare
100% records       9.55M      5.20M     54.4%

Marathon of Quake
on Nightmare       7.53M      4.48M     59.5%

Collection of
Deathmatch demos   9.53M      5.60M     58.8%

Devil's Covenant
movie demos        1.85M      0.59M     31.8%

===========================================================================

Future plans:

Opening of sfx files in gui and extracting them from other platforms
Making plugin files for other file types: zip, rar, etc.

I'm sure there is some interest in expanding the concept of demo
compression to other games/formats like QuakeWorld, Quake2 etc.
Also, I'm fairly confident that the ideas used in Dzip can be
successful for these games, too. However, I'd rather focus on Dzip
as a general-purpose compression program.

===========================================================================

Known Bugs:

Saving a dz file in netscape that is on an http connection may
corrupt the file.  The reason for this is the webserver is sending
the file as plain text since it doesn't recognize the extension.
Adding 'application/x-dzip' as a mime-type for .dz files on the
server will fix the problem.

NOTE: if you find *anything* that seems remotely wrong with the GUI,
please tell me about it by mailing me at the address shown at the
webpage.  In the last few days before a release, I invariably change
things that could have broken some stuff but I didn't get the chance
to retest every feature to make sure they all work.
